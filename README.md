# 👊 Welcome to Avion School!

👋 Hello, Student!

🚀 Welcome to Avion School, and congratulations on taking your first step into becoming a software engineer!

🙇🏽‍♂ The first thing we tell our students is that you must commit to working harder than you ever have before. The time you put in now will return in volumes as we push you to a high-paying career in tech.

❤️ We're in this together. Every instructor, team lead, career guide, and staff member are here to help you succeed.


# 🤔 What is the Pre-course?

🏫 The pre-course is a 12-section program aimed to build your foundation in programming.

🤓 We do this to ensure that our students understand basic technical concepts before moving on to the Main Course, handling larger engineering projects.

👩🏽‍💻 Over the next couple of weeks, we'll tackle the basics of Web Development, all the way from HTML & CSS, to adding functionality to webpages through Javascript!
